# Images

This directory contains your images, pictures, graphics, and similar stuff. The template knows that this is the main path for search for images so that you do not specify the `images/` path when you use `\includegraphics`. For example:

```tex
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{moi-layers-4L.pdf}
\end{figure}
```
